These programs make up a small math library that covers many topics in statistics and probability. 
It has methods to calculate basic statistics (like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance), 
to do combinatorial tasks (like combinations and permutations), and to handle probability calculations 
(such as conditional probability, Bayesâ€™ theorem, binomial and geometric distributions, and checking if 
events are independent or dependent). It also shows how to perform simple set operations 
(union, intersection, and complement) using lists. Each part is in its own class with a tester class, 
making it easier to understand and run the examples.
